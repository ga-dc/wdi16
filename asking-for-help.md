# Asking For Help

## During Normal Weeks

Please make sure to read the [One-on-Ones guidelines](one-on-ones.md)!

We ask that you take the following steps when dealing with technical questions...

1. Try something else
2. Google your exact problem or error
3. Reference the appropriate lesson plan
4. Ask your classmates
5. Ask an instructor during scheduled office hours and one-on-ones

If your question is **non-technical** — you're feeling overwhelmed, or you have questions about a homework or project prompt — please reach out directly to an instructor as soon as possible.

## During Project Weeks

GitHub issues are the most useful method for answering technical questions. At least one instructor will be dedicated to monitoring issues at all times during business hours.

Issues should follow this format:
```
I tried ___.
I expected ___ to happen.
___ happened instead.
My repo link is ___ and my question is about lines ___.
```


[Just click this handy link to create an issue with these blanks inserted for you!](https://github.com/ga-dc/project1/issues/new?title=issue+with+____&body=I+tried+_____.+I+expected+_____+to+happen._____+happened+instead.%0DMy+repo+link+is+___+and+my+question+is+about+lines+___.)

*Please close your issues when you've received a satisfactory answer*, and let us know what the solution was. We'll close issues that have gone more than 30 minutes without any updates.

### Why Issues?

Many reasons! The biggest is that programmers often have the same question. This way, students with the same question can find their answer in one place.

Additionally, having to articulate the question into words is very helpful in understanding the problem. Sometimes, simply articulating the question gives you the answer.

### How?

Below is a guide for the information that must be included when submitting an issue. (You can also use the handy [template](https://github.com/ga-dc/project2/issues/new?title=issue+with+____&body=I+tried+_____.+I+expected+_____+to+happen._____+happened+instead.%0DMy+repo+link+is+___+and+my+question+is+about+lines+___.) above.) It is expected that you will try to debug/solve an issue prior to submitting a request for help on Github.

#### Context

When submitting an issue, please provide some context as to what the problem is. This includes but is not limited to:
- What you are trying to do (in terms of code)
- Detailed description of the bug or error
- Relevant code/files/errors (and screenshots if applicable)
- Gems and/or other technologies being used (if applicable)

#### Approaches Tried

Give information about what you have done to solve the problem. This includes but is not limited to:
- Documentation you have looked at
- Steps you have taken to solve the problem
- Resources you have used

### Can students respond to other students' issues?
**YES!**

### So, when *should* I seek out an instructor in-person?
**We really want you talk to us when it's an emotional issue** more than a technical one.

During certain projects, we'll set aside time for in-person technical support. Further details on this will be announced during project kickoffs.
